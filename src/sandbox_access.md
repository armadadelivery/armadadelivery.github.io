# Testing Environments

## Staging Environment
The Staging Environment serves as the default testing ground before any code is deployed to production. It is designed to be stable, ensuring that the software undergoes thorough testing and validation before moving into the live environment.

### API
For API testing in the staging environment, utilize the following API domain:

## Sandbox Environment
The Sandbox Environment is a development-specific space where testing is conducted on the latest version of the code. While this environment may not be as stable as Staging, it offers the advantage of quick bug identification and fixes. The Sandbox is particularly useful for swiftly addressing issues encountered during testing, allowing for a seamless continuation of the testing process.
