## Authentication

To use our API, you will need to generate an API key through the Armada Merchant UI.
For that, our shared customer (Subscribed business), needs to:

1. Open Sidebar by clicking on the Menu icon in the top left corner of the screen
2. Open Settings page
3. Open API settings page
4. Click on "Generate API Key" button

Once you have the API key, you will need to include it in the headers of all API requests as the "Authorization" parameter, prefixed by the word `Key `.

Eg: `Key somerandomkey-sdfsdfqmk`
