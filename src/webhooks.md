## Webhooks

To receive real-time updates on the status of orders placed through your app, you can provide a webhook URL in the Armada delivery Merchant UI. Our API will send a POST request to this URL any time the status of an order changes.

The list of the statuses:

- `pending`: the order has been received and is waiting to be dispatched to a driver
- `dispatched`: the order has been dispatched to a driver who is on his way to the merchant
- `en route`: the order has been picked up from the merchant and is being delivered to the customer
- `complete`: the order has been successfully delivered
- `canceled`: the order has been canceled from the merchant
- `failed`: the order has failed to find a driver
